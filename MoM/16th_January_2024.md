# Minutes of Meeting(Summary of the meeting held on 16th Jan)

Here is the summary of what happened in the first meet.

We had the meeting for around 25 minutes where we were introduced to basic functionalities the website provides. 

The following things were discussed:-

1. There are around 15,000 ambulances for which this app and website will be used and these ambulances have an EMT assistant.

2. We have a doctor assigned to every group of 25 ambulances. The doctor is supposed to get the data(vitals) recorded by the EMT assistant through the website.

3. The patient will also be categorised as critical,moderate or safe depending upon the vitals recorded according to some mathematical formula. 

4. The doctor will have a document which he can refer to when he needs and this document will be uploaded by him and he will ask for a query and a response must be generated. 

5. We are also supposed to set up a method of communication between the EMT assisant and the doctor in case the doctor wants to assist the EMT assistant for treating the patients. 

6. We also have a to make a login signup page for storing the doctor's profiles explicitly. 

We will be using React and GraphQL for the project.
