# Minutes of Meeting(Summary of the meeting held on 31th Jan)

Here is the summary of what happened in the second meet.

We had the meeting for around 30 minutes where we discuss about the design. 

The following things were discussed:-

1. We discussed the design of the implementation where we pondered upon the point that how the chatbot with the EMT and the LLM model will work together.

2. Further, we discussed how we'll be highlighting the cases based upon their criticality and finalised that a strip will be shown on the left instead of the complete box being that because of contrast issues.
